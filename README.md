## Demo
The final modeled plant is a banana tree!

## L-System 
A series of new classes were created to represent the full system. 

An `Lsystem` class was created to intialize expansion rules and drawing rules, and to take care of expanding and drawing the entire L-system.

axiom: FFFFFFFFF^++A[//------FF++++B]-&&A///^^^A++

The `Turtle` class keeps track of the current position, orientation, branch length, and recursion depth of the expanded grammar.

The `ExpansionRule` class contains a precondition string and a map of probability thresholds to postcondition strings. These rules employ some randomness to ensure the final system is organically formed.

A = [F^//---A][F&++G] (p = 0.8)
A = [^++A]//G (p = 0.15)
A = --F//A (p = 0.05)

B = [C][&&C][&&&+C][&&++C][&+C]//dB (p = 0.7)
B = [C][^C][&-C][&&++C][&++C]\\dB (p = 0.3)

G = [+F+E]-\\\\E (p = 1.0)

The `DrawingRule` class draws some geometry for a specific symbol in the grammar. 

F = branch
E = banana leaf
C = banana

## User Interface
The user has the ability to control the number of expansion iterations, the starting axiom, and the rotation angle used. 

## Rendering
All components of the tree (cylinders, leaves, and bananas) are rendered using instancing and lambertian shading. The background color is generated using FBM noise and a cosine palette.
